Discord Bot Utilizing Yeelight Python Library (Local Only)

This is a simple bot and a fun little project of mine that uses YeeLight python library. The bot can be added to servers of your choosing. However, it requires that you run this bot on a computer with LAN access to your YeeLight Bulbs or on a seperate but with access to your LAN.

Notes:
- Create a discord bot here -> https://discord.com/developers/applications and input your token in the env file. KEEP THIS TOKEN A SECRET! 
- Please enable LAN Control in the YeeLight App. 
- Be sure to have both dot-env and yeelight library installed. Please run pip install if you do not. 
- Do not forget to edit the user editable area in the .py file, changes will be made to this soon.
